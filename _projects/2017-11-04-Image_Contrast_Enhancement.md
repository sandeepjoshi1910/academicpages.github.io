The aim of the project is to perform efficient contrast enhancement with an improvement over traditional contranst enhancement techniques. We use around 7 fuzzy membership functions forming the Fuzzy Inference System which define the pixel manipulation. Since different fuzzy rules operate on different range of pixel values, contrast enhancement is better compared to techniques like Histogram Equalization. Histogram Equalization in our experiment on low resolution images, either over-enhances or under-enhances the images. The paper discusses the experiments in detail with results.
