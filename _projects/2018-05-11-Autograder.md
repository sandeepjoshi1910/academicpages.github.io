This was a course project for CS 421 : Natural Language Processing at UIC. The goal of this project was to build a automatic grading system for TOEFL essays using NLP techniques and basic NLP building blocks such as POS Tagging, Named Entity Recognition, Spelling correction, grammar error detection and text coherence. 

We used various techniques to determine the grade of the essay and the detailed report is accessible below.
