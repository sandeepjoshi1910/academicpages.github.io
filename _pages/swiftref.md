## The Basics

### Constant & Variables

Constants are declared by `let` and variables by `var`. Type is not necessary while declaring them but can also be specified.

``` swift
let numOfHorses = 20
let pi = 3.14
var numDataPoints = 20

var noOfPagesLeft : Int = 35
var currentSwiftVersion : float = 4.1
```

Multiple variables of same type can be defined in a single line

``` swift
var noOfChars, noWords, noOfSentences: Int
```
